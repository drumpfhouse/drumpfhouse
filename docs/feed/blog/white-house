<p>
	<span xml:lang="EN-US">Today marks President Donald J. Trump&#039;s 50th day in office and while delivering his Weekly Address, he spoke about an issue of paramount importance to families across our Nation: healthcare.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
	<p>
		<span xml:lang="EN-US">Seven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people. Our citizens were told they would have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was.</span>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
		<span xml:lang="EN-US">Now we know that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises. And this is why we must repeal and replace Obamacare -- to deliver relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, who right now are being crushed by Obamacare, by increasing freedom, choice, and opportunity for the American people.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	At 15 months old, Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease and not expected to live more than a few short years. To look for a cure, her father, John Crowley, founded a biotechnology company that identified the treatment that halts the progression of Pompe and is credited with saving Megan’s life. Today, John is the CEO of Amicus Therapeutics, a New Jersey biotechnology company with more than 250 employees at the forefront of therapies for rare and orphan diseases. Megan, age 20, is now a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Jessica and Susan are the widows of Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, Placer County, California police officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014 by an illegal immigrant. Their names have been invoked in the Davis-Oliver Bill, congressional legislation which aims to increase cooperation between local and federal officials to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<strong>Carryn</strong><strong> Owens</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Carryn is the widow of Chief Special Warfare Operator William “Ryan” Owens. Chief Owens died heroically last month in an operation in Yemen which yielded valuable intelligence which will protect U.S. national security. Carryn is the proud mother of their three children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

	<strong>Jamiel</strong><strong> Shaw, Sr.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Jamiel Sr.’s son, Jamiel Jr., was a high school football star before he was tragically shot by an illegal immigrant in 2008. A running back for Los Angeles High School, Jamiel Jr.’s tragic death in a gang-related incident ended his life at the age of 17.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>President Trump: Putting Coal Country Back to Work</title>
  <link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/02/16/president-trump-putting-coal-country-back-work</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>
	Today, President Donald J. Trump signed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/38">House Joint Resolution 38</a> to stop the costly Stream Protection Rule from further harming coal workers and the communities that depend on them. H.J.Res. 38 blocks an overly burdensome regulation that threatened the coal industry with millions of dollars in compliance costs, reduced coal production, and fewer jobs.</p>

<p>
	Since 2009, the coal industry has declined, leaving workers and communities without a lifeline. Over 36,000 jobs have been lost without any relief in sight. From 2009 to 2015, American coal production has declined by over 177,000,000 tons, and over 600 coal mines have closed. H.J.Res. 38 will give coal country relief from these harmful regulations created under the Obama Administration.</p>

<p>
	During the campaign, President Trump promised coal workers he would support them and reverse the harmful actions of the past administration. Since taking office, President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on all Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
	President Trump promised to make women’s empowerment a priority. Earlier this week, President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau took the first steps toward making that a reality by creating the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;“In order to create economic growth and lots of very good, well-paying jobs, we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive.”</p>

  <title>ICYMI: Former Law Clerks Herald Supreme Court Nominee Neil Gorsuch&amp;#039;s Independence</title>
  <link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/02/15/icymi-former-law-clerks-herald-supreme-court-nominee-neil-gorsuchs-independence</link>

<p>
	<strong>Former Law Clerks Herald Supreme Court Nominee Neil Gorsuch’s </strong><strong>Independence</strong><br />
	<em>​USA</em><em> Today</em><br />
	By Richard Wolf</p>

<p>
	One thing you can say about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch: He inspires loyalty among his former law clerks, no matter their politics.</p>

<p>
	Every one of them who worked for Gorsuch since he became a judge in 2006 — with the exception of two now clerking at the Supreme Court — signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday heralding his independence that “will never waver.”</p>

<p>
	...</p>

<p>
	In their letter, the former law clerks stressed Gorsuch’s strict adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law, regardless of his opinions. “As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his personal view of what the law should be,” they said. “Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.”</p>

<p>
	“He has never feared staking out a principled position ... even if he had to do so alone,” they wrote. “If confirmed, we are confident that Judge Gorsuch’s independence — grounded in the limited powers granted to the judiciary by the Constitution — will never waver.”</p>

<p>

  <title>President Trump: Cutting Red Tape for American Businesses</title>
  <link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/02/14/president-trump-cutting-red-tape-american-businesses</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The American free enterprise system is the greatest engine for economic success in the world, and this week President Donald J. Trump is taking more steps to roll back the burdensome, Obama-era regulations that are crippling our businesses.</p>

<p>
	Today, President Trump signed legislation (House Joint Resolution 41) eliminating a burdensome regulation that threatened to put domestic extraction companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage. By halting this regulation, the President has removed a costly impediment to American extraction companies helping their workers succeed.</p>

<p>
	President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burdens on everyday Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. He has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.</p>

<p>
	“This is one of many that we&#039;ve signed, and we have many more left.&nbsp; And we&#039;re bringing back jobs big league, we&#039;re bringing them back at the plant level; we&#039;ve bringing them back at the mine level.”</p>

<p>
	Many members of Congress were in attendance at today’s bill signing, including House Speaker Paul Ryan; Representative Jeb Hensarling, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; and other members of the House Financial Services Committee.</p>

<p>
	The Trump Administration is committed to fixing the broken regulatory system, enhancing Americans’ productivity, and unleashing American potential.</p>

  <title>Vice President Pence Casts Historic Vote to Confirm Betsy DeVos</title>
  <link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/02/07/vice-president-pence-casts-historic-vote-confirm-betsy-devos</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="Betsy DeVos" src="/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/20170207_ADM_nominees_web_devos.png" /></p>

<p>
	Friends,<br />
	<br />
	Today, I cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education: Betsy DeVos.<br />
	<br />
	The vote the President asked me to cast wasn’t just for Betsy – it was also for America’s future.<br />
	<br />
	Our nation’s success depends on the education of our students. In Betsy DeVos, we have one of America’s foremost advocates for educational opportunity and excellence.<br />
	<br />
	For nearly three decades she has devoted her time, her talent, and her treasure to ensure that every child in America has the best shot at a better life. Countless students have benefitted from her efforts to promote an educational marketplace defined by innovation, opportunity, and real, meaningful choice.<br />
	<br />
	The President and I agree that our children’s futures should not be determined by their zip code. Students should not be trapped in a system that puts the status quo ahead of a child’s success.<br />
	<br />
	Betsy DeVos will have great impact as Secretary of Education. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a public school, a private school, a parochial school, a charter school, or any other kind of school – she will help ensure that every student has access to a good school.<br />
	<br />
	We are grateful to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and all the Republican Senators who stood with us on this important vote.<br />
	<br />
	The President is fully committed to this mission. Today’s vote was the first of its kind in our nation’s history, but the real history will be made through our unwavering dedication to America’s children – and to America’s future.<br />
	<br />
	Thank you for all your help and support.<br />
	<br />
	Sincerely,<br />
	<br />
	Michael R. Pence<br />
	Vice President of the United States&nbsp;</p>
