<p>
	SEC. 201.<strong>&nbsp;SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS.</strong></p>

<p>
	It is the sense of Congress that—</p>

<p>
	(1) honoring current national space commitments and building upon investments in space across successive Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by the United States, in collaboration with its international, academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity’s reach into deep space, including cis-lunar space, the Moon, the surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;</p>

<p>
	(2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the United States space program by continuing to develop a balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science, including continued development of the Space Launch System, Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services Program;</p>

<p>
	(3) a national, government-led space program that builds on current science and exploration programs, advances human knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and with our international partners, is of critical importance to our national destiny and to a future guided by United States values and freedoms;</p>

<p>
	(4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;</p>

<p>
	(5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by working with industry to streamline existing programs and requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint, and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight, accountability, and safety;</p>

<p>
	(6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and enhance its leadership in space exploration and space science, and continue to expand freedom and economic opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent with the Constitution of the United States; and</p>

<p>
	(7) NASA should be a multi-mission space agency, and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.</p>

<p>
	SEC. 202.<strong>&nbsp;FINDINGS.</strong></p>

<p>
	Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p>
	(1) Returns on the Nation's investments in science, technology, and exploration accrue over decades-long timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could prevent returns from being fully realized.</p>

<p>
	(2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments, particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have disrupted completion of major space systems thereby—</p>

<p>
	(A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in space science and human space exploration;</p>

<p>
	(B) placing such investments in space science and space exploration at risk; and</p>

<p>
	(C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.</p>

<p>
	(3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ155.109.pdf">Public Law 109–155</a>; 119 Stat. 2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ422.110.pdf">Public Law 110–422</a>; 122 Stat. 4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&amp;section=18301">42 U.S.C. 18301</a>&nbsp;et seq.) reflect a broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education, that serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this Act.</p>

<p>
	(4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and industry partners is—</p>

<p>
	(A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United States space program; and</p>

<p>
	(B) imperative to continuing United States global leadership in human space exploration, science, research, technology development, and education opportunities that contribute to development of the next generation of American scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the opportunity for economic development of low-Earth orbit.</p>

<p>
	(5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration systems with the near-term objectives of the initial integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in 2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-lunar space and eventually to the surface of Mars.</p>

<p>
	(6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch United States government astronauts from United States soil into low-Earth orbit by the end of 2018.</p>

<p>
	(7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.</p>

	(1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&amp;section=18312">42 U.S.C. 18312</a>); and</p>

<p>
	(2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the Nation.</p>

<p>
	(c)&nbsp;Continuation Of The ISS.—Section 501 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&amp;section=18351">42 U.S.C. 18351</a>) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p>
	<strong>“SEC. 501.&nbsp;CONTINUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.</strong></p>

<p>
	“(a)&nbsp;Policy Of The United States.—It shall be the policy of the United States, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.</p>

<p>
	“(b)&nbsp;NASA Action.—In furtherance of the policy set forth in subsection (a), NASA shall—</p>

<p>
	“(1) pursue international, commercial, and intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply, maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize United States operations costs relating to the ISS;</p>

<p>

<p>
	“(3) utilize, if practical and cost effective, the ISS for Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.”.</p>

<p>
	SEC. 302.<strong>&nbsp;TRANSPORTATION TO ISS.</strong></p>

<p>
	(a)&nbsp;Findings.—Congress finds that reliance on foreign carriers for United States crew transfer is unacceptable, and the Nation’s human space flight program must acquire the capability to launch United States government astronauts on vehicles using United States rockets from United States soil as soon as is safe, reliable, and affordable to do so.</p>

<p>
	(b)&nbsp;Sense Of Congress On Commercial Crew Program And Commercial Resupply Services Program.—It is the sense of Congress that—</p>

<p>
	(1) once developed and certified to meet the Administration’s safety and reliability requirements, United States commercially provided crew transportation systems can serve as the primary means of transporting United States government astronauts and international partner astronauts to and from the ISS and serving as ISS crew rescue vehicles;</p>

<p>
	(2) previous budgetary assumptions used by the Administration in its planning for the Commercial Crew Program assumed significantly higher funding levels than were authorized and appropriated by Congress;</p>

<p>
	(3) credibility in the Administration’s budgetary estimates for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an independently developed cost estimate;</p>

<p>
	(4) such credibility in budgetary estimates is an important factor in understanding program risk;</p>

<p>
	(5) United States access to low-Earth orbit is paramount to the continued success of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory;</p>

<p>
	(6) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the capability to launch United States government astronauts from United States soil into orbit, ending reliance upon Russian transport of United States government astronauts to the ISS which has not been possible since the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011;</p>

<p>
	(7) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program and Commercial Resupply Services Program that have allowed private sector companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012;</p>

<p>
	(8) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at launch sites across the United States to support NASA's Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and commercial space flight missions; and</p>

<p>
	(9) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be continued in a manner that leverages State and private investments to achieve the goals of that program.</p>

<p>
	(c)&nbsp;Reaffirmation.—Congress reaffirms—</p>

<p>
	(1) its commitment to the use of a commercially developed, private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew missions as expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ155.109.pdf">Public Law 109–155</a>; 119 Stat. 2895), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ422.110.pdf">Public Law 110–422</a>; 122 Stat. 4779), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&amp;section=18301">42 U.S.C. 18301</a>&nbsp;et seq.); and</p>

	SEC. 431.<strong>&nbsp;FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION.</strong></p>

<p>
	Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p>
	(1) In accordance with section 204 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report entitled, “Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration”.</p>

<p>
	(2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy communities.</p>

<p>
	(3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational rationales for human space flight together constitute a compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of Mars.</p>

<p>
	(4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the rationales include economic benefits, national security, national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared destiny.</p>

<p>
	(5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight program.</p>

<p>
	(6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development as needed to achieve the long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars.</p>

<p>
	(7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and objectives.</p>

<p>
	(8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph (1), there are several independently developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human space exploration, including NASA's “The Global Exploration Roadmap” of 2013, “NASA's Journey to Mars–Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration” of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's “Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to Mars” of 2015, and Explore Mars' “The Humans to Mars Report 2016”.</p>

<p>
	(2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap, addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with international, academic, and industry partners;</p>

<p>
	(3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and implementation would influence future development and implementation; and</p>

<p>
	(4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with low-Earth orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond low-Earth orbit to cis-lunar space, and then address future missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then on the surface of Mars.</p>

<p>
	SEC. 441.<strong>&nbsp;SHORT TITLE.</strong></p>

<p>
	This subtitle may be cited as the “To Research, Evaluate, Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act” or the “TREAT Astronauts Act”.</p>

<p>
	SEC. 442.<strong>&nbsp;FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.</strong></p>

<p>
	(a)&nbsp;Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p>
	(1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty.</p>

<p>
	(2) As United States government astronauts participate in long-duration and exploration space flight missions they may experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment, bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation. Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can result in acute and long-term health consequences that can increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and vision.</p>

<p>
	(3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration space flight missions, United States government astronaut Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space while his identical twin brother, former United States government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction of the human body to an extended period of time in space.</p>

<p>
	(4) Since the Administration currently provides medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States government astronauts during their active employment, given the unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government astronauts for psychological and medical conditions associated with human space flight.</p>

<p>
	(b)&nbsp;Sense Of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—</p>

<p>
	(1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown and lead the world in space exploration and scientific discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual mission to Mars;</p>

<p>
	(2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many diseases humans face on Earth;</p>

<p>
	(3) the Administration should provide the type of monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique to the training or exposure to the space flight environment of United States government astronauts and should not require any former United States Government astronauts to participate in the Administration’s monitoring;</p>

<p>
	(4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not replace a former United States government astronaut's private health insurance;</p>

<p>
	(5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in the astronaut corps; and</p>

<p>
	(6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the ISS—</p>

<p>
	(A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-duration space flight; and</p>

<p>
	(B) will help support the physical and mental well-being of astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the future.</p>
